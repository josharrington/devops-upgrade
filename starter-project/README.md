# Starter Project

Because a DevOps Engineer is not an entry-level position, you need to be able to demonstrate your skills to employers to make it in this field. You will need to show off your skills in systems management, networking, development, and release management. The projects in this repo will give you some foundations to build on and let you build a portfolio to exhibit your new-found skillset.

This is *not* a comprehensive guide on everything you need to know, it is only a rough outline to get you familiar with much of the typical work in this field.

A few tips:
1. Read the section in its entirety before starting on it.
2. Take your time.
3. At the bottom of each section will be a list of acceptance criteria. You should do your best to meet every item.
4. Feel free to [submit an issue](https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-your-work-on-github/creating-an-issue) to this repo for assistance.

At the end of this project, you will have a fully built, cloud native service using modern tools and technologies. You will be able to show it off to employers to give yourself a leg up over other candidates. Let's get started!

# Part 0 - Requirements

1. Get a Github account. You need somewhere to save your code and to show it off! If you've never used git before, [start here](https://product.hubspot.com/blog/git-and-github-tutorial-for-beginners). Feel free to switch out for Gitlab if you prefer, just remember to adjust the instructions below to your needs.
2. Get a good code editor. If you don't already have a favorite, VS Code is a good choice and works on all platforms.
3. Set aside some time several times per week to work on this. Don't let it stagnate.
4. Any computer you have access to will be able to perform all these steps. You do not need special equipment.
5. A credit card. Costs will be minimal but you will probably need to spend a little money here, <$100 USD.
